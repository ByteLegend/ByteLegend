# Contribute to ByteLegend

## All Kinds of Contribution are Welcomed

- Game data contributor:
  - You see a typo or bad translation in a text, like mission description, UI prompt, etc.
  - You see a tutorial better than any existing ones, and you want to share it with the whole world (and earn coins)!
- Game map contributor:
  - You see a flaw in the game map, like a bad tile image, or incorrectly marked tile (e.g. you can walk into a sea tile).  
- Game code contributor:
  - You see a bug in the game code (either frontend or backend or game script) and you want to fix it.
- Game creator:
  - You want to build a new map on top of infrastructure provided by ByteLegend.

## Prerequisite

You need to install the software:

- For game data contributor: your favorite text editor.
- For game map contributor: a map editor named [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).
- For game code contributor and game creator:
  - [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
  - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (Ultimate version or Community version, it doesn't matter)
  - [Java 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

## Contribute to Game Data

**DON'T clone `ByteLegend/ByteLegend` main repo if you just want to contribute to game text data - it's several GBs - because it contains a lot of game resources.**

If you see bad texts in the game, you can clone [the game data repo `ByteLegend/game-data`](https://github.com/ByteLegend/game-data).
We intentionally put all text resources in a separate repo so you can clone it must faster.

Search the wrong text with your favorite text editor, fix the issue then create a pull request.

You can also follow the guidance [here](https://github.com/ByteLegend/ByteLegend/blob/master/docs/en/i18n.md#help-us-via-github-web-ui) to fix the issue via GitHub web UI.
