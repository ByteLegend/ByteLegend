# Internationalization in ByteLegend

## How It Works

[ByteLegend](https://bytelegend.com) is designed to be internationalized. All UI texts, game texts are referenced as a "text id" in the source code.
The real content of the texts are maintained in [`game-data/`](https://github.com/ByteLegend/server). You can search in the repository and create a
pull request to fix anything bad you see in the game.

We provide English and simplified Chinese officially, which means all English and simplified Chinese texts are translated by human.
By default, texts in other languages are translated by machine (Google translation API) at build time automatically,
but you can help translate them (texts translated by human have higher priority).
We appreciate your contribution.

## Add a New Language

Currently, we support the following languages([here](https://github.com/ByteLegend/ByteLegend/blob/master/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/bytelegend/app/shared/i18n/Locale.kt#L70) is the source code):

- English
- 简体中文
- 繁體中文
- Español
- العربية
- Português
- Bahasa Indonesia
- Français
- 日本語
- Русский
- Deutsch
- 한국어
- Italiano

To add a new language, follow the steps below. You don't need to translate everything. Remember what we said above?
All texts can be translated by machine automatically.

- Add your language into the source code [here](https://github.com/ByteLegend/ByteLegend/blob/master/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/bytelegend/app/shared/i18n/Locale.kt) with:
  - `displayName`, like `English` or `简体中文`
  - `languageScript`, defined by <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924>
  - `countryRegion`, defined by <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166>
  - a function to recognize the new language from `Accept-Language` HTTP header.
- Create a pull request in <https://github.com/ByteLegend/ByteLegend/pulls>
